/* 8 Kyu - Total Amount of Points */
/******************************** */
/* Our football team has finished the championship.

Our team's match results are recorded in a collection of strings. Each match is represented by a string in the format "x:y", where x is our team's score and y is our opponents score.

For example: ["3:1", "2:2", "0:1", ...]

Points are awarded for each match as follows:

if x > y: 3 points (win)
if x < y: 0 points (loss)
if x = y: 1 point (tie)
We need to write a function that takes this collection and returns the number of points our team (x) got in the championship by the rules given above.

Notes:

our team always plays 10 matches in the championship
0 <= x <= 4
0 <= y <= 4

function points(games) {
    return games.map( e => {
        if (+e[0] > +e[2]) {
            return 3;
        } else if (+e[0] < +e[2]) {
            return 0;
        } else {
            return 1;
        }
    }).reduce((acc, c) => acc + c, 0);
